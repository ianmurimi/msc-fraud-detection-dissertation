## ðŸ“˜ Abstract

This research investigates how deep learning modelsâ€”particularly **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, and **Denoising Autoencoders (DCAEs)**â€”can be used to detect and mitigate motor vehicle insurance fraud through image classification.

The project addresses a key challenge in fraud datasets: **extreme class imbalance** and adversarial behavior in real-world claims. To overcome this, I implemented a GAN to synthetically augment minority-class (fraud) images and trained a CNN classifier on the augmented dataset. To improve robustness, a denoising autoencoder was introduced as a preprocessing step.

> The final model achieved near-perfect classification performance while maintaining generalization across noisy and imbalanced datasetsâ€”highlighting its real-world applicability in high-stakes decision systems.

## ðŸ“Œ Context

This project was completed independently as part of my MSc in Artificial Intelligence. All research, experimentation, and writing were done by me, with academic supervision limited to general guidance.

The research touches on early-stage **AI safety themes**, particularly around model robustness, adversarial examples, and fairness in classification topics I plan to explore further in cooperative AI research.
